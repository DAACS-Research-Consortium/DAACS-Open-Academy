# Welcome to Session 4: Using R to Clean Data

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! 
You will need an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account login to continue with today's class.  
The login is free and quick to create. 

Today we will explore a new dataset in R. We will look for errors and show you some simple ways to fix them.
The code used today reinforce code you learned in previous weeks.
A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

1. Reading R code
2. Using functions to summarize and group data
3. Making our first plot

## Goals for today:

1. Understand the importance of exploring your dataset 
2. Learn more small steps in R by exploring the SC dataset using the arrange, filter, and mutate functions
3. Understand the differences in how Excel handles these processes and how R handles them
4. Make more plots!
