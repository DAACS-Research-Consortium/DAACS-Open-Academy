# Welcome to Session 3: Small Steps in R

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! In this session we are going to continue exploring a sample dataset in R and learn more about ggplot.
A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

1. Reading R code
2. Using functions to summarize and group data
3. Making our first plot

## Goals for today:

1. How to explore your dataset using R packages/functions
2. Understand the differences in how Excel handles these processes and how R handles them
3. Explore the Stewart Castle dataset
4. Make more plots!

## Before we get into the code -- a quick poll.
How many people already have datasets you are currently working with or want to work with?

## On to the exercises
