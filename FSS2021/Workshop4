# Welcome to Session 4: Using R to Clean Data

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! You will need an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) login to 

In this session we are going to continue exploring a sample dataset in R and learn more about ggplot.
A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

1. Reading R code
2. Using functions to summarize and group data
3. Making our first plot

## Goals for today:

1. Understand the importance of exploring your dataset 
2. Learn more small steps in R by exploring the SC dataset using the arrange, filter, and mutate functions
3. Understand the differences in how Excel handles these processes and how R handles them
4. Make more plots!
