# Welcome to Session 4: Using R to Clean Data

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! 
You will need an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account login to continue with today's class.  
The login is free and quick to create. 

Today we will explore a new dataset in R. We will look for errors in a dataset and show you a simple way to fix them.
The code used today reinforces concepts you learned in previous weeks and introduces some new ones.
A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

1. Reading R code
2. Using functions to summarize, group, arrange, filter, and mutate data
3. Making plots!

## Goals for today:

1. Learn how to critically look at a dataset and plan corrections.
2. Learn how add new variables and observations.
3. Use two new functions ifelse(...) and c(...) to make these changes.
4. Learn about nested functions.
