# Welcome to Session 3: Small Steps in R

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! In this session we are going to continue exploring a sample dataset in R and learn more about ggplot.
A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

    Reading R code
    Using functions to summarize and group data
    Making our first plot

Goals for today:

    How to explore your dataset using R packages/functions
    Understand the differences in how Excel handles these processes and how R handles them
    Explore the Stewart Castle dataset
    Make more plots!

Before we get into the code -- a quick poll.
