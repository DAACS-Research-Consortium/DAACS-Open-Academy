## Quick Review
1. Load the packages
2. Import CSV
3. Check out the dataframe

## Exercise 1
We are going to use the function "arrange" on the SCV dataframe.
Explore the output after you run lines 32 and 33.  
1. What did the arrange function do to the dataset?
2. How does running the function this way differ from doing it in Excel?
