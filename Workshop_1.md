# Workshop 1: Creating a Digital Dataset That Meets Your Research Needs

## Goals
### Participants will learn:
* How your research objectives are directly linked to the types of data you collect and how you collect them.
* How to develop and refine research questions that can be answered with archaeological evidence/data.
* How to identify and collect the data you need to answer your research questions.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1 (10 min)
#### **Objective:** Provide practice with taking an example/very general research topic and honing it into a research question and hypotheses
**Example research areas:**
1. You are interested in enslaved African and African American identity and agency in North America and the Caribbean between 1700-1865. 
2. You would like to study European and Native American interactions in 17th-century North America.
3. You want to study local and regional craft production and trade in the American Southeast.

##### **To do:**
* With your group, choose one of the three general research ideas. 
* Identify two examples of “so what” of the topic. What could the answer to this topic achieve or change?
* Form hypotheses (bring your own theoretical leanings to your group!).
* Return to the classroom and share ideas.

### Exercise 2 (10 min)
#### **Objective:**  Identify the material culture attributes and field data types that will serve as variables to answer your hypotheses and research questions.  
##### **To do:**
* With your group, choose the material culture and field data types that would help you answer the questions you developed in Exercise 1. 
* Identify what archaeological materials you will need to answer those hypotheses (will you need more than one artifact type?)
* Your questions may change or evolve as you think through material culture specifics.
* Explain your choices. 
* Return to the classroom and share ideas. 

### Exercise 3 (15 min)
#### **Objective:** Create a sample spreadsheet with the fields you deem essential for collecting variables you will use to test your hypotheses and answer your research question
##### **To do:**
* Identify your variable fields (columns) and how you will organize your rows. These are the essential attribute fields for each material type that will help you answer your questions. 
* Identify what variable types will go in each field (e.g. open text, controlled vocabulary, measurements)
* Why have you chosen these variables and data types?
* It is perfectly valid to say you need to know more about specific artifact types. If so, what do you need to know more about?
* Return to the classroom and share ideas.
