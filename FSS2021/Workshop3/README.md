Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! In this session we are going to continue exploring a sample dataset in R and learn more about ggplot.

Project for today in RStudio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/project/3037046

## A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

1. Reading R code
2. Using functions to summarize and group data
3. Making our first plot

## Goals for today:

1. Understand the importance of exploring your dataset 
2. Learn more small steps in R by exploring the SC dataset using the arrange, filter, and mutate functions
3. Understand the differences in how Excel handles these processes and how R handles them
4. Make more plots!

## Before we get into the code -- a quick poll.
Do you have a digital dataset that you planning on working with R?

If so, would you like us to offer an extra hour after the workshops for a help session?
