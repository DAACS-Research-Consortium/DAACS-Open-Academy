# DAACS-Intro-to-R
This repository contains the materials for Lesson 1 of the DAACS Fall 2021 Short Course: Introduction to R Programming for Historical Archaeologists.  It is meant to be followed through as the lesson and then reviewed later as reference materials.
Dr. Pete Alonzi developed the materials for the first two workshops.  

## Goals
Everyone will:
1. leave the lesson with a functional understanding of the R environment using RStudio.
2. be comfortable or at least on their way to being comfortable with R and Rstudio.
3. be equipped to find solutions to the problems they encounter using R.

### Quick Poll
1. Everyone raise your hand
2. Lower your hand if you started programming within the last 5 years
3. Lower your hand if you started programming in the last 10 years
.....

Everyone look at the last person with their hand up
