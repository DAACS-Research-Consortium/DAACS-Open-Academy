# Welcome to Session 5: Mean Ceramic Dates and TPQs in R

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! In this lesson we'll learn how to use R to compute mean ceramic dates (MCDs) and *terminus post quem*s (TPQs). Note to the classical R-chaeologists in the crowd: Yup, that should be *termini post quos*:). We'll also make use of some of the data-wrangling and cleaning skills we learned in previous lessons.  

## The plan and goals for today:

1. Learn a bit about the model of change over time in type frequencies that is (covertly) being invoked when we compute MCDs. And how to check if the model assumptions are met in your data. 
2. Write some R code to compute MCDs for a simple dataset -- assemblages from San Marcos Pueblo in New Mexico.
    - Learn about numeric vectors and matrices
    - Learn how to write our own functions!  
3. Compute MCDs for a more challenging set of data from stratified deposits sampled at the slave village site at Stewart Castle, Jamaica.
    - Do some data wrangling to combine very small assemblages from adjacent layers
    - Have peek at some more complex functions that we ad our collaborators use working with data from the DAACS database.  
4. And as always, make more plots!
