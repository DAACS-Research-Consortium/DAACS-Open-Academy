# Part 4: Confidence Limits
So far we have just computed what in the stats biz are called "point estimates" of relative frequencies (*alias* proportions) and AIs from an assemblage. That's cool!

But our estimate would be cooler if they also included an inictation of how "confident" we are about the accuracy of the estimate for a given assmblage. 

A thought experiment...
- Your have  following data from Site and and Site B
*```Site     Ceramics  WBG```*
```Site A    
 

Our confidence will be a function of sample size: the bigger the assmblage, the more "confident" we should be that out estimate is close to the true value.
