# Welcome to Session 6: Calculate and Plot Relative Frequencies and Abundance Indices in R

Welcome back! It is December and you have made it to Workshop 6! 

And if you are new, welcome! 

In this lesson we'll learn how to calculate two different types of relative frequencies--conventional relative frequencies and abundance indices--and how to plot them.
We will make use of some of the data-wrangling and data cleaning skills we learned in previous lessons.

## The plan and goals for today:

1. Learn how to compute and plot conventional "vanilla" relative frequencies in R.
2. Meet their more bespoke cousin, the abundance index. You will also learn how to calculate and plot AI data.
3. Learn how to create and plot confidence limits for the data.
4. Ditto TPQs.
5. Write some R code to compute MCDs for a simple dataset -- ceramic assemblages from a stratified sequence excavated from a 1-meter quadrat in the slave village site at Stewart Castle, Jamaica.
    - Refresh our data-wranging and cleaning skills from last time.
    - Compute MCDs for the stratified assemblages.
    - Compute TPQs too!  
6. And as always, make more plots! Including cool *battleship plots* like this:
