# Workshop 2: Choosing Digital Tools for Archaeological Research

## Goals
### Participants will learn:
* About different digital tools and recognize when to apply them.  For example:
    * When do you use a spreadsheet?
    * When do you use a database?
    * When do you use a stats package?
    * When do you use a tool to manipulate data?

* How to create a digital dataset that meets your research needs while also conforming to the best practices of Open Science.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1 (10 min)
#### **Objective:** Create the framework for a sample CERAMIC dataset. Create a data structure for the data you want to capture about the object. 
##### To do:
1. Introduce yourselves!
2. Create a basic spreadsheet of variables to capture information from ceramic objects (or should we keep this artifact oriented)? 
   * With your group, identify the artifact attributes you would record in the variable field.
3. Watch the video of this object.
4. Catalog that object into your data structure.  Answer the following questions:
   * What worked? What didn't work?  Were you missing attributes you wish you had?  Did you have attributes you didn't use?
5. Return to the classroom and share ideas.
