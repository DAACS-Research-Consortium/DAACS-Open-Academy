# Workshop 3: Working with Legacy Digital Data

## Goals
### Participants will learn:
* How to read legacy data and identify analytical weak spots
* How to identify the bottlenecks in legacy data that may restrict the types of questions you can ask.
* How to address productively the unique challenges of legacy data. 
* The basics of data wrangling: identify gaps in the data and discrepancies, learn how to remove or mediate these issues during the data standardization process.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1: Working with Data (10 min)
#### **Objective:** Practice recognizing bias in legacy datasets and what impact they have on research outcomes for projects that reuse the data.
##### To do:
1. Introduce yourselves!
2. Answer as a group:

What kinds of research questions could you answer using the following datasets?  What questions could you not answer?

* The collection has context records with quadrat numbers, coordinates, and sediment descriptions by level, and bags with artifacts that have Context IDs based on quadrat and level but no maps or site report.

* You have artifacts labeled by catalog number, an artifact inventory that links the catalog number to a unit/level, and site maps with features, but no unit forms, photos, or site report.

* You want to compare collections from two sites that date to the same time period each that you know once had multiple structures standing on them.  Both collections consist of artifacts with provenience labels, context records, and maps.  The excavation extent of one site is an STP survey.  The excavation of second site is comprised of units clustered around structures.  


### Exercise 2: I Spy -- Spotting and Mitigating Issues with Legacy Digital Data -- Follow along
#### **Objective:** Demonstrate some of the common challenges to working with digital legacy datasets and how to handle them
##### To do:
1. [Navigate to this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKVIOOTnZZVc-G8SdDYSmKjpKT3a2_quZJLSszunIB4/edit#gid=881604718).  
2. Please save a copy onto your own machine.  
3. Look at the first tab. Find as many errors as you can using the process outlined in the slides.
4. Look at the second tab. Find errors, parse data by adding new fields you deem necessary and adding standardized terminology.
5. Check out the key (which will be shared).
