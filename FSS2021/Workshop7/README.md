# Welcome to Workshop 7: How to do Seriations in R Using Correspondence Analysis   

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! In this workshop we'll learn the basics of doing correspondence analysis (hereafter CA) in R and how to interpret the results. The canonical application of CA in archaelogy is to do seriations. But CA is also a powerful exploratory tool to discover and evaluate patterns that lie hidden in the kind of high-dimensional count data that abounds in our discipline.

1. You will need an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account login to continue with today's class. The login is free and quick to create.
2. If you want to learn more about CA, there is not better place to start than Micheal Greenacres's *Correspondence Analysis in Practice*. You can find a pdf of the second edition here:http://www.ru.ac.bd/stat/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/03/503_01_Greenacre_Correspondence-analysis-in-practice.pdf

## The plan and goals for today:

1. Quick review of the frequency-seriation model and MCDs (see Workshop 5).
2. Introduction to CA basics -- with a simple seriation example. 
3. CA of some real-world data: ceramic assemblages from Morne Patate, Dominica.
4. And as always, make more plots!
