# Part II: Introduction to CA Basics -- With a Simple Seriation Example.

## 1. CA from Geometric Perspective.
- There are severy different ways to underasaoindd CA and mtivte the math behind it. We'll start with geometry. We can think of the rows of our data table (the assemblages) as points in space. The each axis of the space measures the relative frequency of a type. In our MCD example, we had three types. So there are three axes. Here they are:
