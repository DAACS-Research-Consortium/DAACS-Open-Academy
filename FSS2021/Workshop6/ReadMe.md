# Welcome to Session 6: Calculate and Plot Relative Frequencies and Abundance Indices in R

Welcome back! It is December and you have made it to Workshop 6! 

And if you are new, welcome! 

In this lesson we'll learn how to calculate two different types of relative frequencies--conventional relative frequencies and abundance indices--and how to plot them.
We will make use of some of the data-wrangling and data cleaning skills we learned in previous lessons.  

## Important Links

1. You will need an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account login to continue with today's class. The login is free and quick to create. 
2. Project for today in RStudio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/project/3293533
3. Find recordings for all previous Introduction to R workshops here: https://vimeo.com/digdaacs

## The plan for today is to:

1. Learn how to compute and plot conventional "vanilla" relative frequencies in R.
2. Meet their more bespoke cousin, the abundance index. You will also learn how to calculate and plot AI data.
3. Learn how to create and plot confidence limits for the data.
4. Refresh our data-wranging and cleaning skills from last time.
    - Get comfortable with using mutate to create new variables.
    - Think through data cleaning and organization.  
    - Reacquaint ourselves with ggplot to make cool plots.  
5. Finally, we will be staying after class today to help anyone with questions or problems related to their own research datasets.
