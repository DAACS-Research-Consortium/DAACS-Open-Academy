# The Plan 

Today we will explore a new dataset in R. We will look for errors in a dataset and show you a simple way to fix them.
The code used today reinforces concepts you learned in previous weeks and introduces some new ones.  

A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

1. Reading R code
2. Using functions to summarize, group, arrange, filter, and mutate data
3. Making plots!

## Goals for Today

1. Learn how to critically look at a dataset and plan corrections.
2. Learn how add new variables and observations.
3. Use two new functions ifelse(...) and c(...) to make these changes.
4. Learn about nested functions.
