## Quick Review
1. Load the packages
2. Import CSV
3. Check out the dataframe
4. Remember this thing: the `<-` operator 'catches' the output of functions and stores them in variables.

## Exercise 1 - `arrange(...)`
We are going to use the function "arrange" on the SCV dataframe.
Explore the output after you run lines 32 and 33.  
`SCVSortbyPhase <- StewartCastleVillage %>%
  arrange(DAACSPhase)`
1. What did the arrange function do to the dataset?
2. How does the output created in R differ from what is produced using a similar function in Excel?
