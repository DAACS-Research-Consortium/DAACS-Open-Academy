# Welcome to Session 4: Using R to Clean Data

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! 
You will need an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account login to continue with today's class.  
The login is free and quick to create. 

Today we will explore a new dataset in R. We will look for errors and show you some simple ways to fix them.
The code used today reinforces concepts you learned in previous weeks and introduces some new ones.
A quick recap of the topics we covered last time:

1. Reading R code
2. Using functions to summarize, group, and mutate data
3. Making plots!

## Goals for today:

1. Learn basic tools and critical 
2. Learn more small steps in R by exploring the SC dataset using the arrange, filter, and mutate functions
3. Understand the differences in how Excel handles these processes and how R handles them
4. Make more plots!
