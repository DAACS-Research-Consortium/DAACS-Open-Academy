# Exercises for Workshop 1
## Exercise 1
### **Objective:** Provide practice with taking an example/very general research topic and honing it into a research question
**Example research topic:**
Can archaeologists correctly distinguish building loci from architectural disposal areas using nails?
#### **To do:**
* Compare the current topic with the criteria for a strong research question: clear, focused, concise, complex, measurable, arguable, ethical. 
* Identify two examples of “so what” of the topic. What could the answer to this topic achieve or change?
* Rephrase the topic into a more focused question.

## Exercise 2
### **Objective:**  Identify potential hypotheses and material attributes that will serve as variables to answer the research question.  
#### **To do:**
* Identify potential outcomes for this question.  Formulate those outcomes into two different hypotheses.
* Identify what archaeological materials you will need to answer those hypotheses (will you need more than one artifact type?)
* Identify what attributes you will need to record.
* Identify what variable types you will need to use.

## Exercise 3
### **Objective:** Create a sample spreadsheet with the fields you deem essential for collecting variables and answering your question
#### **To do:**
* Identify your variable fields (columns) and how you will organize your rows
* Identify what variable types will go in each field (open text, formalized terms?)
