# Workshop 2: Choosing Digital Tools for Archaeological Research

## Goals
### Participants will learn:
* About different digital tools and recognize when to apply them.  For example:
    * When do you use a spreadsheet?
    * When do you use a database?
    * When do you use a stats package?
    * When do you use a tool to manipulate data?

* How to create a digital dataset that meets your research needs while also conforming to the best practices of Open Science.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1 (10 min)
#### **Objective:** Create the framework for a sample CERAMIC dataset. Create a data structure for the data you want to capture about the object. 
##### To do:
1. Introduce yourselves!
2. Open this link to a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1685ZhEmZsuC35tjdZ-Oosy1e2OmHWrN49u7FlBzWr9o/edit?usp=sharing). Create your own tab for    your group.  Create a basic spreadsheet of variables to capture information from ceramic objects (or should we keep this artifact oriented)? 
   * With your group, identify the artifact attributes you would record in the variable field.
3. [Watch this artifact video](https://vimeo.com/574561557)
4. Catalog that object into your data structure.  Answer the following questions:
   * What worked? What didn't work?  Were you missing attributes you wish you had?  Did you have attributes you didn't use?
5. Return to the classroom and share ideas.

### Exercise 2 (7 min) -- Follow along
#### We'll demonstrate some of the pitfalls of sorting, filtering, and use pivot tables in Google Sheets.
