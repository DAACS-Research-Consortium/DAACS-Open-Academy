# DAACS-Intro-to-R
These materials are for Workshop 1 of the DAACS Fall 2021 Short Course: Introduction to R Programming for Historical Archaeologists.  It is meant to be followed through as the lesson and then reviewed later as reference materials.
Dr. Pete Alonzi from the University of Virginia School of Data Science developed the materials for the first two workshops.  

The link to the video of workshop 1 is here: https://vimeo.com/623828934.

## Goals
Everyone will:
1. leave the lesson with a functional understanding of the R environment using RStudio.
2. be comfortable or at least on their way to being comfortable with R and Rstudio.
3. be equipped to find solutions to the problems they encounter using R.

### Quick Poll
