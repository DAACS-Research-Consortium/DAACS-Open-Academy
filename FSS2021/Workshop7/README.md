# Welcome to Workshop 7: How to do Seriations in R Using Correspondence Analysis   

Welcome back! And if you are new, welcome! In this workshop we'll learn the basics of doing correspondence analysis (hereafter CA) in R and how to interpret the results. The canonical application of CA in archaelogy is to do seriations. But CA is also a powerful exploratory tool to discover and evaluate patterns that lie hidden in the kind of high-dimensional count data that abounds in our discipline.

## The plan and goals for today:

1. Quick review of the frequency-seriation model and MCDs (see Workshop 5).
2. Introduction to CA basics -- with a simple seriation example. 
3. CA of some real-world data: ceramic assemblages from Morne Patate, Dominica.
4. And as always, make more plots!
