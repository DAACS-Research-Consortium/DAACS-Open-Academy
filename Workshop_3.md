# Workshop 3: Working with Legacy Digital Data

## Goals
### Participants will learn:
* How to read legacy data and identify analytical weak spots
* How to identify the bottlenecks in legacy data that may restrict the types of questions you can ask.
* How to address productively the unique challenges of legacy data. 
* The basics of data wrangling: identify gaps in the data and discrepancies, learn how to remove or mediate these issues during the data standardization process.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1: Working with Data (10 min)
#### **Objective:** Practice recognizing bias in legacy datasets and what impact they have on research outcomes for projects that reuse the data.
##### To do:
1. Introduce yourselves!
2. With your group, choose the ceramic attributes (variables/columns) that you would like to record.
3. Put the attributes into columns into a worksheet in the [Google workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1685ZhEmZsuC35tjdZ-Oosy1e2OmHWrN49u7FlBzWr9o/edit?usp=sharing) provided. Name the worksheet with group member names.

### Exercise 2: Working with Legacy Digital Data (7 min) -- Follow along
#### **Objective:** Demonstrate some of the common challenges to working with digital legacy datasets and how to handle them
