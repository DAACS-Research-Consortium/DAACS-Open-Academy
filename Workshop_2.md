# Workshop 2: Choosing Digital Tools for Archaeological Research

## Goals
### Participants will learn:
* About different digital tools and recognize when to apply them.  For example:
    * When do you use a spreadsheet?
    * When do you use a database?
    * When do you use a stats package?
    * When do you use a tool to manipulate data?

* How to create a digital dataset that meets your research needs while also conforming to the best practices of Open Science.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1: Create a Ceramic Data Table (10 min)
#### **Objective:** Practice creating a data table to capture information from ceramic artifacts.
##### To do:
1. Introduce yourselves!
2. With your group, choose the ceramic attributes (variables/columns) that you would like to record.
3. Put the attributes into columns into a worksheet in the [Google workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1685ZhEmZsuC35tjdZ-Oosy1e2OmHWrN49u7FlBzWr9o/edit?usp=sharing) provided. Name the worksheet with group member names.
   * With your group, identify the artifact attributes you would record in the variable field.
4. Return to the classroom after 10 minutes.
5. [Watch this artifact video.](https://vimeo.com/574561557) Pay close attention to the ceramic sherd attributes.
6. Return to your breakout room and catalog the artifacts into your data sheet. You can watch the video again.
7. What worked? What didn't work? What would you add? Did you have attributes you didn't use? Return to the classroom and share ideas.

### Exercise 2: Potential Spreadsheet Pitfalls (7 min) -- Follow along
#### **Objective:** Demonstrate some of the pitfalls of sorting, filtering, and using pivot tables in Google Sheets.
